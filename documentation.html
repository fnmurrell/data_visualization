    <h2>The Design Process</h2>   
    <p>How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs / ideas you attempted in the beginning? Show screenshots of
        my initial ideas from the Miro Board.</p>

    <h2>Rational for Design Choices</h2>
    <p>A rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? 
        Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?
    </p>

    <h2>Answering the Questions</h2>
    <p>Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. 
        Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization.</p>

    <p>YouTube Songs: The top 40 included 5 children's songs.</p>
    <p>Spotify Songs: Didn't include any songs released from the past two years. Seems like people craved some nostalgia in their listening habits.</p>
    <p>TikTok Songs: Unsurprisingly, all the top TikTok songs were due to being populer soundtracks for TikTok videos.</p>
    <p>Pandora Songs: Not much overlap with the previous lists. Similar to Spotify, though, the top 40 songs were not recently released. Most of them were from the 00s.</p>
    <p>Deezer Songs: This top 40 list included almost exclusively songs released in the past two years.</p>
    <p>SiriusXM Songs: Typical of radio, the top 40 list included songs released mostly from the past 4 years.</p>
    <p>Apple Music Songs: Harry Styles, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, and Justin Bieber made frequent appearances on all top 40 lists.</p>
    <p>SoundCloud Songs: This platform seems to be the place to go for rap songs. XXXTentacion was the artist name that appeared 4 times.</p>
